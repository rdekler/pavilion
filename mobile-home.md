    <h2>Victoria's Lost Pavilion</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Victoria’s Lost Pavilion, a virtual simulation of a pavilion 
built for Queen Victoria and extant in the gardens of Buckingham Palace 
from 1842-1928. Now lost to time, the pavilion featured significant 
aesthetic and material experiments in fresco painting and the decorative
 arts. Though comprising only three small rooms, the pavilion in many 
ways came to express the aspirations and anxieties of a young empire. By
 modeling the pavilion and its artwork in digital space, the VLP project
 invites researchers, students, and the public to explore a spectacular 
Victorian time capsule for the array of artistic styles, histories, and 
critical conversations which it transmits.</p>

    <p>Using caches of historical materials and industry-standard architectural
 software, we have built a virtual three-dimensional model of the 
pavilion to facilitate interactive engagement with this lost piece of 
history. Because the past can never be completely recovered, and because
 no building ever completely resembles its plans, the VLP is best 
conceived as a model, a visualization of cultural heritage which hews to
 our source materials while also experimenting with how we experience 
such models immersively and through the web. </p>
    <p>The model itself is based upon site plans, sections, and elevations as 
primarily recorded in Ludwig Gruner’s book The Decorations of the 
Garden-pavilion in the Grounds of Buckingham Palace, lavishly 
illustrated and published for the Queen by request in 1846. Building 
outlines are extruded and detailed in architectural software, then 
textured with materials and scans of the pavilion’s interior views and 
artworks. This visualized model furnishes several ways of experiencing 
the pavilion and interacting with its contents.</p>

    <p>Over a dozen well-known artists and numerous skilled craftsman created 
the frescos, encaustic paintings, and decorations within the pavilion. 
The main octagon room features eight lunettes designed after scenes from
 John Milton’s Comus and painted in fresco. Paintings in one of the side
 rooms pay homage to the novels of Sir Walter Scott. The opposite side 
room is decorated in the style of Pompeii, inspired by artifacts from 
archaeological recoveries at the time. </p>

    <p>This website offers more in-depth discussions of the building’s history 
and artworks, found through the site’s primary menu. You can also choose
 from several different ways of exploring the space around the pavilion,
 the building structure, and its decorated rooms. Try experiencing the 
self-guided immersive walkthroughs, panoramic images, and essays 
highlighting the different stories the pavilion helps us tell. The 
website also points to the further research this project has enabled and
 shares some digital versions of its original source materials. 
Ultimately, we hope the project offers an educational experience for a 
lost piece of cultural history which was, even at the time, inaccessible
 to most people interested to see it. We also hope Victoria’s Lost 
Pavilion helps promote interdisciplinary scholarship on its intersecting
 domains of literature, architecture, archaeology, fresco, and other 
decorative arts.</p>
