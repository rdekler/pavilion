A selection of reviews are presented here with illustrations from the project:

Jameson, Anna. ["Introduction" to *The decorations of the garden-pavilion in the grounds of Buckingham palace*]({{"https://pavilion.chass.ncsu.edu/tours/historical-reviews/jameson-intro/"}}). Ed. Ludwig GruÌˆner. London: John Murray, 1846. 6-10. As the introduction to this significant volume and as a printed pamphlet distributed to journalists visiting the pavilion, Jameson's essay has had an outsize influence on the pavilion's historiography.

["A Visit to the Garden Pavilion in the Grounds of Buckingham Palace."]({{"https://pavilion.chass.ncsu.edu/tours/historical-reviews/chambers-review/"}}) Chambers's Edinburgh Journal. Saturday, August 30, 1845. The Chambers's review responds directly to the Athenaeum's skepticism, praising instead the "fairy palace" of the pavilion and borrowing substantially from Jameson's narrative.
