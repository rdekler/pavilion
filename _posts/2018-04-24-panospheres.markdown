A panosphere (or "photo sphere") is a set of adjoining images stitched together into a panoramic sphere which can simulate an immersive viewing experience. Google has integrated the technology into the "street view" feature of their online maps. The spheres of the pavilion were generated from snapshots inside the textured model, and are then layered on to a street view of the historical location in Buckingham Palace Gardens. Below, you can look around each room and navigate between them.
